# ClaudePod üêã

A comprehensive workflow system for **orcas**trating multiple Claude Code instances working in coordinated pods on parallel development tasks using git worktrees.

## Overview

Just like orcas hunt in coordinated pods, ClaudePod **orcas**trates multiple Claude Code instances working simultaneously in isolated worktrees. Each Claude operates in its own pod (worktree), enabling intelligent parallel development, seamless coordination, and clean separation between different tasks.

### Key Features

- **üêã Pod Isolation**: Each Claude operates in its own isolated worktree pod
- **ü™ü Terminal **Orca**stration**: Automatic Terminal.app window management on macOS  
- **üìã Task Coordination**: Built-in progress tracking with TASK.md files
- **ü§ù Context Handoff**: Seamless context passing between pod members via git commits
- **üßπ Clean **Orca**nization**: Automatic branch creation, merging, and cleanup
- **‚ö° Parallel Intelligence**: Multiple Claude instances working in harmony
- **üéØ Pod Status**: See all active pods and their coordination at a glance

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Clone or download** the pod files to your project directory
2. **Run the setup script**:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
3. **Start your first task**:
   ```bash
   pod new auth-system
   ```

### Basic Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start a new task (creates worktree + opens Terminal)
pod new user-authentication
# OR for dangerous permissions:
# pod yolo user-authentication

# This creates:
# - New branch: work/user-authentication
# - Worktree: ../user-authentication-worktree/
# - Opens Terminal in the worktree directory
# - TASK.md file for tracking progress

# 2. In the new Terminal window that opens:
# You'll be in the worktree directory on the new branch
claude          # Launch Claude Code (or your editor)
# OR
code .          # VS Code
vim .           # Vim, etc.

# 3. Work on your task, make commits as you go
git add .
git commit -m "Implement login form"

# 4. Save progress and context for handoff (optional)
pod handoff user-authentication "Login flow completed, working on logout"

# 5. See all active tasks from anywhere
pod list

# 6. Complete task (merge & cleanup)
pod done user-authentication

# 7. Check overall status anytime
pod status
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **macOS** (for Terminal.app integration)
- **Git** (version 2.5+)

|---------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `pod new <task>` | `n` | Create new worktree and launch Claude | `pod new auth-system` |
| `pod yolo <task>` | | Create task with --dangerously-skip-permissions | `pod yolo risky-task` |
| `pod list` | `ls` | List all active tasks | `pod list` |
| `pod status` | `st` | Show detailed status overview | `pod status` |
| `pod done <task>` | `d` | Complete, merge, and cleanup task | `pod done auth-system` |
| `pod handoff <task> [msg]` | `h` | Create context handoff commit | `pod handoff auth-system "Login working"` |
| `pod cleanup` | `c` | Clean up orphaned worktrees | `pod cleanup` |
| `pod update` | `up` | Update pod to latest version | `pod update` |

### Command Details

#### `pod new <task-name>`
Creates a new development task with:
- Isolated git worktree in `../<task-name>-worktree/`
- New branch with `work/` prefix
- TASK.md file for progress tracking
- New Terminal window that attempts to launch Claude Code

**What happens:**
1. Creates isolated worktree directory
2. Sets up new branch from your main/master branch
3. Opens new Terminal window and navigates to worktree
4. Attempts to run `claude` (the Claude Code CLI command)
5. If Claude CLI isn't installed, you can manually run your preferred editor

**Example:**
```bash
pod new user-profile
# Creates: work/user-profile branch
# Directory: ../user-profile-worktree/  
# Opens: New Terminal in worktree directory
# Runs: claude (or your configured editor)
```

#### `pod yolo <task-name>`
Special mode that creates a task and launches Claude with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Use this when you need Claude to have broader file system access.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** YOLO mode skips permission checks - use carefully!

**Example:**
```bash
pod yolo system-config
# Creates: work/system-config branch  
# Directory: ../system-config-worktree/
# Opens: Terminal with "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions"
# Shows: Warning about YOLO mode
```

#### `pod list`
Shows all active tasks with status indicators:
- üü¢ **Active**: Worktree exists, no changes
- üü° **Working**: Uncommitted changes present  
- üîµ **Ready**: Commits ready to merge

#### `pod status`
Comprehensive overview showing:
- Current branch
- All git worktrees
- Active task details
- Branch relationships

#### `pod done <task-name>`
Completes a task by:
1. Checking for uncommitted changes
2. Switching to main branch
3. Pulling latest changes
4. Merging feature branch
5. Cleaning up worktree and branch
6. Updating task tracking

#### `pod handoff <task-name> [message]`
Creates a handoff commit for context sharing:
- Stages all current changes
- Creates commit with handoff message
- Updates TASK.md with progress
- Enables smooth context transfer

## Daily Workflow Examples

### Scenario 1: Multiple Independent Features

```bash
# Morning: Start multiple parallel tasks
pod new user-authentication    # Claude 1: Auth system
pod new product-catalog       # Claude 2: Product features  
pod new payment-integration   # Claude 3: Payment system

# Check what's active
pod list
# üü¢ user-authentication (work/user-authentication)
# üü¢ product-catalog (work/product-catalog)  
# üü¢ payment-integration (work/payment-integration)

# Afternoon: Save progress and switch focus
pod handoff user-authentication "Login/logout complete, need password reset"
pod handoff product-catalog "CRUD operations done, working on search"

# Evening: Complete finished work
pod done payment-integration   # First completed feature
pod status                     # Check remaining work
```

### Scenario 2: Sequential Development

```bash
# Start with architecture
pod new core-architecture

# Once architecture is ready, start dependent tasks
pod handoff core-architecture "Database schema and API structure defined"
pod new api-implementation     # Based on architecture
pod new frontend-components    # Can work in parallel

# Complete in dependency order
pod done core-architecture
pod done api-implementation  
pod done frontend-components
```

### Scenario 3: Bug Fix Workflow

```bash
# Urgent bug fix
pod new fix-login-issue

# Work on fix, test, document
pod handoff fix-login-issue "Identified root cause: session timeout"
pod handoff fix-login-issue "Fix implemented, testing edge cases"

# Complete when verified
pod done fix-login-issue
```

## Task Organization

### TASK.md Structure

Each worktree contains a `TASK.md` file for tracking:

```markdown
# Task: user-authentication

**Branch:** work/user-authentication  
**Created:** 2024-01-15 09:30:00  
**Status:** In Progress  

## Description
Implement complete user authentication system with login, logout, 
registration, and password reset functionality.

## Progress
- [x] Initial setup
- [x] Login form and validation
- [x] JWT token handling  
- [ ] Password reset flow
- [ ] Email verification
- [ ] Testing and documentation

## Notes
- Using bcrypt for password hashing
- JWT stored in httpOnly cookies for security
- Integration with existing user database

## Handoff Information
Latest handoff: "Login flow completed, logout working. 
Next: implement password reset email system."
```

    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Branch Naming

By default, branches use the `work/` prefix. To customize:

```bash
# Edit pod script
WORKTREE_PREFIX="feature/"  # Changes to feature/task-name
WORKTREE_PREFIX=""         # No prefix: just task-name
```

### Terminal Window Management

MCC uses AppleScript to manage Terminal windows:

```bash
# Windows are automatically titled with task names
# Example: "Claude: user-authentication"

# Arrange windows manually or use window management tools
# like Rectangle, Magnet, or built-in macOS features
```

### Integration with IDEs

While MCC launches Terminal with Claude Code, you can also:

```bash
# Open worktree in VS Code
code ../task-name-worktree/

# Or other editors
subl ../task-name-worktree/
vim ../task-name-worktree/
```

### Custom Claude Code Command

If your Claude Code installation has a different command name:

```bash
# Edit pod script, change:
CLAUDE_CMD="claude-code"
# To:
CLAUDE_CMD="your-custom-command"
```

## Coordination Strategies

### Managing Dependencies

1. **Plan Task Order**: Start with foundational work
2. **Use Handoffs**: Share context frequently
3. **Merge Regularly**: Avoid long-running branches
4. **Communicate**: Use commit messages and TASK.md

### Avoiding Conflicts

1. **File Separation**: Work on different files when possible  
2. **Feature Flags**: Use flags for incomplete features
3. **Small Commits**: Make atomic, focused commits
4. **Regular Rebasing**: Keep branches up to date

### Context Sharing

```bash
# Before switching focus
pod handoff current-task "Current status and next steps"

# After resuming  
git log --oneline -5  # Review recent commits
cat TASK.md          # Read task context
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Not in a git repository"
```bash
# Initialize git repo
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

#### "Worktree directory already exists" 
```bash
# Clean up manually
rm -rf ../task-name-worktree/
git worktree prune

# Or use different task name
pod new task-name-v2
```

#### "claude: command not found"
This happens if the Claude CLI isn't installed or isn't in your PATH.

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Option 1: Install Claude CLI
# Download from: https://claude.ai/download
# Or follow setup instructions for your system

# Option 2: Use any editor in the Terminal that opens
# The Terminal will be in the worktree directory, so just run:
claude        # If you have Claude installed
code .        # VS Code
vim .         # Vim
subl .        # Sublime Text
# etc.

# Option 3: Update pod script with your preferred command
# Edit the CLAUDE_CMD variable in the pod script:
CLAUDE_CMD="code"     # for VS Code
CLAUDE_CMD="subl"     # for Sublime Text
# etc.
```

#### "Merge conflicts"
```bash
# During pod done, if conflicts occur:
git status                    # See conflicted files
# Resolve conflicts manually
git add resolved-files
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
pod done task-name           # Retry
```

#### "Terminal window not opening"
```bash
# Check Terminal permissions in System Preferences > Security & Privacy
# Or run Claude Code manually:
cd ../task-name-worktree/
claude-code
```

### Recovery Commands

```bash
# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove orphaned worktree
git worktree remove ../task-worktree/ --force

# Clean up branches  
git branch -D work/task-name

# Reset active tasks tracking
rm .pod/active_tasks.txt
pod list  # Rebuilds tracking
```

### Debug Mode

For troubleshooting, add debug output:

```bash
# Edit pod script, add after #!/bin/bash:
set -x  # Enable debug mode
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Custom configuration
export MCC_WORKTREE_PREFIX="feature/"
export MCC_CLAUDE_CMD="my-claude-command"  
export MCC_TERMINAL_APP="iTerm"  # Future: other terminal support
```

### Per-Project Settings

Create `.podrc` in your project root:

```bash
# .podrc
WORKTREE_PREFIX="epic/"
CLAUDE_CMD="claude-dev"
```

## Integrations

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pod-check.yml
name: MCC Branch Check
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Check MCC branches
      run: |
        # Custom checks for work/ branches
        git branch -r | grep work/ && echo "Work branches detected"
```

### IDE Extensions

Future integrations could include:
- VS Code extension for MCC management
- Sublime Text plugin
- Vim/Neovim integration

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use pod with existing branches?**  
A: MCC creates new branches with the `work/` prefix. To use existing branches, manually create worktrees with `git worktree add`.

**Q: What happens if Claude Code crashes?**  
A: The worktree remains intact. Simply `cd ../task-worktree/` and run `claude-code` again.

**Q: Can I use multiple main branches?**  
A: Currently MCC assumes one main branch. For multiple bases, manually specify: `git worktree add -b new-branch ../path existing-branch`.

**Q: How do I backup my work?**  
A: All work is in git. Use `git push origin work/branch-name` to backup individual branches.

**Q: Can I customize the TASK.md template?**  
A: Yes, edit the `new_task()` function in the pod script to customize the template.
